airSlate Auth is a simple authentication application created as a pet project to showcase my skills in frontend development. The project demonstrates user authentication features with modern tools and technologies.

## Features

- Three main pages: **Home**, **Login**, and **Registration**.
- Seamless navigation between pages using React Router.
- A **Login** form with:
  - Email and password input fields.
  - Validation for user inputs.
- Built with scalable, modern technologies and architecture.
- Future improvements:
  - Firebase integration for authentication and user management.
  - Redux Toolkit for state management.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- **ReactJS**: As the core library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: To manage state and side effects.
- **React Hook Form**: For form validation and handling.
- **Redux**: For managing global application state.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **Firebase**: Planned integration for backend services.
- **Vite**: For fast development and bundling.
- **Netlify**: For deploying the application and hosting.
